# DexiNed Fine Tuning and Evaluation Repository

This is the repository which contains the adapted DexiNed code from [Soria et al.](https://github.com/xavysp/DexiNed). It adapts some of the base scripts from DexiNed for the purposes of fine tuning and testing. The repository also contains the scripts utilised for evaluation (i.e. the ODS/OIS F-score and AP Scores and the Temporal Consistency).

# Prerequisites:

For the purposes of testing, you will need to fill the checkpoints folder with some of the checkpoints of the fine tuning versions implemented in the dissertation. These can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/11jE3KV-cE1BbMNU8t5QQr-rEMr-L9dBt). To test on something, we have also provided the HyperKvasir sequences which were tested on for the Dissertation, in addition to one of the combined test datasets and one of the isolated test datasets (Datasets 1 and 4 . These are all located [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1bxryu9bDaOi53Lbky4gLtXXyzJ-iY9HY). These datasets were generated by the data processing pipeline [here](https://github.com/ParhomEsmaeili/Dissertation-Data-Processing).

Required Packages for the Python Scripts include:

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/g)
* [Pytorch >=1.4](https://pytorch.org/) (Last tested 1.12)
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/users/installing.html)
* [Kornia](https://kornia.github.io/)
* [Natsort](https://pypi.org/project/natsort/)
* Other package like NumPy, h5py, PIL, json. 

For the purposes of computing ODS/OIS F-scores and AP scores you will require a couple of MATLAB toolboxes:

* [Piotr Dollar's Computer Vision MATLAB Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox)
* [Piotr Dollar's Structured Edge Detection Toolbox](https://github.com/pdollar/edges)

The first toolbox should replace the folder named "toolbox" in the "ODS OIS F-Score Scripts" Folder. The second toolbox should replace the folder named "edges" in the "ODS OIS F-Score Scripts" folder. 


## Project Architecture

First we give an overview of the architecture inherited from [Soria et al.](https://github.com/xavysp/DexiNed#performance) with notes on any adaptations.
